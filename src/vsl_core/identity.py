        Named with a leading underscore on purpose: this is the bare

        the fix for a real gap an external review caught -- a public
        `re_enable()` invited direct use, when the only audited path should
        ever be `governance.request_re_enablement()`. The underscore is a
        stronger signal than a docstring warning alone, though Python still
        can't make this a hard guarantee (see below).

        Always returns a brand-new Instance with a new IdentityKey; never
        mutates self, and the old Instance/IdentityKey are never reused --
        Re-Enablement is a reset of eligibility, not of the audit trail.

        `evidence` is a required Evidence object, not two optional loose
        strings: the spec states Re-Enablement "requires root-cause
        analysis and a specification-update proposal as evidence," and
        Evidence.__post_init__ enforces both fields are non-empty.

        Note on enforcement: this is the mechanism, not the sanctioned
        policy path. It intentionally has no knowledge of GovernanceAuthority
        or HumanAuthorisedTransition (identity.py stays dependency-free, per
        the module's build-order position) and is still directly callable
        by anyone with an Instance and an Evidence object -- exactly like
        AutomationDeniedException's "cannot be silently caught" is a
        convention rather than a language-enforced guarantee, this method
        cannot itself prevent a caller from bypassing
        governance.request_re_enablement(). Callers who need the audited,
        authority-attributed path should go through
        governance.request_re_enablement(), which pairs this call with a
